# Weather App using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
This project is a simple web application that allows users to check the weather for a specific city. It's built using standard web technologies such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The app provides a user-friendly interface for entering a city name and retrieves real-time weather data from a weather API.

This repository demonstrates how to build a simple weather app using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Users can input a city name to retrieve weather data, and the app displays information such as temperature, humidity, and wind speed. It also includes error handling to show a message for invalid city names.
